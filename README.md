# Hidden-Markov-Model-Part-of-Speech-Tagger-
Hidden Markov Model part-of-speech tagger for any natural language like English, Chinese etc. Tokenized training data is used for training and the implemented tokenizer will add the tags to the words of the text(data) given for test.
Training Data and Development Data are used in the project. There are two programs: hmmlearn.py will learn a hidden Markov model from the training data, and hmmdecode.py will use the model to tag new data.
